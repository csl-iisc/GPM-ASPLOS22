/**
 * @ingroup tablet
 * @brief Grows the fixed_block of a tablet by moving the variable block back
 *
 * Expands the fixed-size block of the tablet by moving the variable block back
 * farther. This is a convenience function for other tablet functions, and
 * leaves the tablet inconsistent because no virg_tablet_meta.possible_row or
 * column information is edited, so it should be followed up with these changes
 * to the tablet as well. Note that if the variable size block has a size of
 * zero, this is very easy, as we just move its location back in the meta
 * information. If not, however, we must perform a safe memory copy to transfer
 * its contents farther back in the tablet.
 *
 * @param tab	Pointer to the tablet to be changed
 * @param size	Additional size to be added to the fixed block
 * @return VIRG_SUCCESS or VIRG_FAIL depending on errors during the function
 * call
