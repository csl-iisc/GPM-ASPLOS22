/**
 * @ingroup virginian
 * @brief Executes a SQL query
 *
 * This function is the primary driver of SQL queries. Though it is simple and
 * its actions can be called directly, this interface should be sufficient for
 * most purposes. The reader pointer should not point to an allocated block, as
 * it will be reassigned. See the virg_reader documentation for more information
 * on accessing results. Once results are no longer needed, virg_release()
 * should be called to clean up after the query, otherwise you will probably
 * leak memory.
 *
 * @param v Pointer to the state struct of the database system
 * @param reader Pointer to a pointer to a reader of results
 * @param query SQL query string
 * @return VIRG_SUCCESS or VIRG_FAIL depending on errors during the function
 * call
