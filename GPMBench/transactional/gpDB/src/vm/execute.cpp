/**
 * @ingroup vm
 * @brief Execute the virtual machine using its stored statement
 *
 * Execute the opcodes that have been stored in the passed virtual machine
 * struct, choosing the execution location based on the options set in the
 * virginian struct. This function executes the top-level opcodes that must be
 * handled serially. Like the CPU virtual machine, this function uses a jump
 * table to access code blocks with opcodes, rather than a switch statement. The
 * jump table is simply an array of label addresses that is accessed using the
 * integer value of each opcode, then jumped to with a goto. This function is
 * also responsible for fetching the first data tablet of each loaded table and
 * allocating the first result tablet, then releasing the final locks on the
 * data and result tablet pointers at the end of the query, probably after the
 * pointers have been altered by the lower-level execution functions.
 * virg_vm_gpu() or virg_vm_cpu() is chosen based on the options in the
 * virginian struct, and there is currently no capability to handle both
 * simultaneously, as this would probably involve a more complex threading
 * system.
 *
 * @param v     Pointer to the state struct of the database system
 * @param vm	Pointer to the context struct of the virtual machine
 * @return VIRG_SUCCESS or VIRG_FAIL depending on errors during the function
 * call
