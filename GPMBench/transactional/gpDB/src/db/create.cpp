/**
 * @ingroup database
 * @brief Create and initialize a new database
 *
 * Create a database by initializing the virg_db struct that is stored within
 * the virginian struct. The Virginian database can only have a single database
 * open at once, so this should not be called if another database has been
 * opened and has not yet been closed. Within the database struct we initialize
 * our listing of tables and tablets, showing that each is empty. Additionally,
 * we open the database file based on the the file argument, since we may need
 * to write to it before virg_db_close() is called.
 *
 * @param v Pointer to the state struct of the database system
 * @param file Location on disk where the database file should be written
 * @return VIRG_SUCCESS or VIRG_FAIL depending on errors during the function
 * call
